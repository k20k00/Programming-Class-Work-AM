/* 
Instructions:
	-the program should prompt the user to enter a download speed in Mb/s (Megabits per second). 
	-it should then prompt the user to enter the size of the file that will be downloaded
	-it should then ask for the unit for the file to be downloaded: KB,MB or GB (kiloByte,megaByte,gigaByte)
	-it should then calculate the estimated time to download the file in seconds.
		(see below examples for how the input output should look like)
	-if the user entered an invalid input it should print "invalid input" and close the program


Note use these conversion rates: 
	8 bits = 1 Byte
	and standard metric prefixes (mega =1000 kilo and giga=1000mega)

Variable Assignment (DownloadSpeedCalculator) - 
 - numb1 is the variable entered by the user to find out the download speed that is being used to get the amount of time the download will take
 - numb2 is the variable entered by the user to find out the size of the file so you can divide that by the download speed while they are in 
similar file types (Mb and Mb or Gb and Gb etc..)

*Each variable is changed once by the user*

int numb1
int numb2

print "Enter download speed (Mb/s)"
read input from user (numb1)
print "Enter the size of the file to be downloaded"
read input from user (numb2)
print "unit for the file to be downloaded: KB,MB or GB"
read input from user (check for valid input)
print numb2 "Estimated download time"
