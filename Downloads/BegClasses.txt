Learning Targets:

I can create a class.
Learn how to create instance variables, methods and constructors in a class.

Create a class called: "Animal"

The class should have the following properties:

species (String)
name    (String)
color 	(String)
age     (int)


The class should have a constructor that takes in 3 strings (Color,Name,Species) and
initializes species, name and color to be the values of the inputs of the constructor.
Age should be initialized to 0;

The class should have the following methods  (they all should return nothing):

MakeSound()  - Prints the message: "Grrrrr" to the screen

SetAge(int newAge) -> sets the age property to be the value of newAge

PrintDescription() -> prints: name +" is a "+year+" year old, "+color+" "+species
