For this problem, you must allow the user to enter exactly 5 numbers as initial input.
The program must then ask for an additional number.

The output of the program will indicate whether the last number is contained in the first 5 numbers.
Your output should resemble that provided in the example below.

You may assume all of the numbers that will be entered are integers(whole numbers).


Test Case Examples:

Input			Output
			Enter a number: 
1
			Enter a number: 
2
			Enter a number: 
5
			Enter a number: 
10
			Enter a number: 
15
			Enter the number to be searched: 
10
			The number 10 appears in the first 5 numbers.


Example2:

Input			Output
			Enter a number: 
10
			Enter a number:

10
			Enter a number: 
15
			Enter the number to be searched: 
60
			The number 60 does not appear in the first 5 numbers.

*For this problem I made seperate test cases to test to make sure that the program used all 5 different input slots to look for the
number or if it only used one, I also tested negative numbers and numbers that are numbers similar to the number being searched for.*
