For this problem, you must allow the user to enter exactly 5 numbers as initial input.
The program must then ask for an additional number.

The output of the program will indicate whether the last number is contained in the first 5 numbers.
Your output should resemble that provided in the example below.

You may assume all of the numbers that will be entered are integers(whole numbers).


Test Case Examples:

Input			Output
			Enter a number: 
1
			Enter a number: 
2
			Enter a number: 
5
			Enter a number: 
10
			Enter a number: 
15
			Enter the number to be searched: 
10
			The number 10 appears in the first 5 numbers.


Example2:

Input			Output
			Enter a number: 
10
			Enter a number: 
22
			Enter a number: 
57
			Enter a number: 
10
			Enter a number: 
15
			Enter the number to be searched: 
60
			The number 60 does not appear in the first 5 numbers.

Variable Assignment (beg_testcases2) - 
 - numb1 is a variable entered by the user that is to be searched through later on
 - numb2 is a variable entered by the user that is to be searched through later on
 - numb3 is a variable entered by the user that is to be searched through later on
 - numb4 is a variable entered by the user that is to be searched through later on
 - numb5 is a variable entered by the user that is to be searched through later on
 - numb6 is the number entered by the user that is trying to be found in the numb1, numb2, numb3, numb4, and numb5 variables.

*Each variable is only changed once*

int numb1
int numb2
int numb3
int numb4
int numb5
int numb6
print "Enter a number to be searched"
read input from user (numb1)
print "Enter a number to be searched"
read input from user (numb2)
print "Enter a number to be searched"
read input from user (numb3)
print "Enter a number to be searched"
read input from user (numb4)
print "Enter a number to be searched"
read input from user (numb5)
print "Enter a number to be searched"
read input from user (numb6)
if (numb6 == numb5 || numb6 == numb4 || numb6 == numb3 || numb6 == numb2 || numb6 == numb1)
print numb6 "appears in the first 5 numbers"
else
print numb6 "does not appear in the first 5 numbers"
