2. Decoding Roman Numerals

King Julien of the Lemurs tells Gloria the Hippo and Melman the Zebra about a community of
Geckos. Those Geckos do not use the same numbering system that the Lemurs use. When Gloria
meets the Geckos, their leader Geckus Leaderus explains that they use Roman Numerals. Help
Gloria convert the Roman Numerals into decimal (base ten) numerals.
	Recal that Roman Numerals work as follows: Each numeral-character (I,V,X,L,c) has
a single value: I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100. The value of a Roman Numeral is the sum of
its numeral-characters unless a small numeral-character is placed in front of a larger
numeral-character, in which case the smaller numeral-character is subtracted from the total.
For instance, VI=5+1, while IV=5-1.
You may assume that at most one subtraction is required per number.

Input/output Format:

Inputs are in the form of text strings for Roman numerals, seperated by spaces on a single
line. Output must a single line for each numeral in the format ""X translated to Y", where
X is the string for the Roman numeral and Y is its decimal value.

Summary: To find when this program would have a bug you have to find when Roman Numerals
don't translate well or at all and find invalid characters that could be entered to
make the program output an error, or you find patterns in Roman Numerals that don't work
such as I C I which doesn't work because it has more than one addition or subtraction.

Test Cases:
Input (X)
I XXXXX V
Output (Y)
INVALID (L inplace of XXXXX)

Input (X)
C L x
Output (Y)
INVALID (Lowercase X)

Input (X)
C, L, X
Output (Y)
INVALID (Commas do not need to be used)

Input (X)
I C I
Output (Y)
INVALID (I used on both sides)

Input (X)
I C 7
Output (Y)
INVALID (7 is not valid)
