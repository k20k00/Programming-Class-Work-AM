Learning Targets:

I can create a class.
Learn how to create instance variables, methods and constructors in a class.

Create a class called: "Student"

The class should have the following properties:

studentID 		(int)
name    		(String)
contentGrade	(double)
workHabitGrade	(double)
participation	(double)
age     		(int)



The class should have a constructor that takes in a String and 2 ints (Name,ID,age) and
initializes name,studentID and age to be the values of the inputs of the constructor.
all 3 grades should be initialized to 0;

The class should have a second constructor that takes no inputs.  This should initialize the fields:



The class should have the following methods  (they all should return nothing):

SetContentGrade(int grade)  - sets the contentGrade property to be the value of grade

SetWorkHabitGrade(int grade) -> sets the workHabitGrade property to be the value of grade

SetParticipation(int grade) -> sets the participation property to be the value of grade

GetGrade() -> returns the overall grade  (.35*workHabitGrade + .4*contentGrade +.25*participation)

printGrade() -> prints the overall grade (same as above)
