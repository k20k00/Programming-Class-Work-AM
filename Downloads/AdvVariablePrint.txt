//Create a new project to do the following  (you can use intellij to create a java project)
// you should not actually be doing the math for this but writting it for the program to do.

//Create 3 integer variables named "var5" "var1" and "var2"
//initialize var1 to 5 and var2 to 6  //you will change this later
//multiply "var1" and "var2" together and put the result in "var5"
//print the value of var5
//increase var1 by 1
//add 3 to var1 and put the result in var1
//print the value of var1
//set var1 to be the number 7
//subtract var1 from var2 and put it into var2
//print the value of var2
//set var1 to be the number 12
//increase the value of var1 by 7.
//print the value of var1
//subtract var1 from the result of multipling var1 and var2 together and put the result in var5
//print the value of var5
//create a new variable named var3 and initialize it to 8
//add var3 var1 and var2 together and put it into var5
//print the value of var5
//update var5 to be the value of var5 divided by the value of var3
//print the value of var5
//create a new variable named var4 and initialize it to be 9
//subtract var3 from var4 and put the result in var3
//print the value of var3
//multiply var5 by var3 and put it into var5
//print the value of var5
//using only the variable var5 and the addition operator, double the value of var5.
//update var5 to be 1/3rd of its current value.
//print the value of var5
