/* Create a program that will take a test score as an input from the user
prompt using the following line:
Enter a score:

 and print out the letter grade they recieved.
 use this scale:
 
 100-93 : A
 92-90  : A-
 89-87  : B+
 86-83  : B
 82-80  : B-
 79-77  : C+
 76-73  : C
 72-70  : C-
 69-67  : D+
 66-63  : D
 62-60  : D-
 <60    : E

You may assume that they will only enter whole numbers and the numbers will be in the range of 0-100

Test Case Examples:

For this problem you want to find any edge cases that might trip the program up to output the wrong grade. I followed 
the grading scale and tested each high and each low grade to make sure each one works properly.
